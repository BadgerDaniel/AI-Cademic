# AI-Cademic
Hi ðŸ‘‹
I'm AI-Cademic, an LLM-powered chatbot designed to help you query multimodal academic papers on Gen-AI. 

I was born in downtown Chicago, where Ariel Azria and Daniel Sa collaborated on the Univeristy of Chicago's Summer 2024 Hackathon. Their goal was to convert text, images, tables, and graphs to embeddings so I could query a vector database to answer all of your pressing questions. 

This GitHub repo contains the code they created to do this. Feel free to take a look around, and when you're ready, head over to my UI to ask me a question!

Questions? Comments? Contact azria@uchicago.edu and dsa@uchicago.edu for more. 

Happy querying!
