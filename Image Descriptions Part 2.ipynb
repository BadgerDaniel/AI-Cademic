      "This page discusses various aspects of tokenization and its challenges in language models. The key points include:\n",
      "- **Negative Transfer in MTLMs**: Multitask learning models (MTLMs) may perform worse than models focused on single tasks due to issues like negative task transfer and catastrophic forgetting.\n",
      "- **Experimentation on Task Sets and Prompts**: Studies show varying approaches in fine-tuning to balance task sets and the importance of prompt templates.\n",
      "- **Closed-Source Model Imitation**: It appears models like ChatGPT by OpenAI are emulated but show substantial capability gaps when using fine-tuned open-sourced models.\n",
      "- **Tokenizer-Relevance**: Tokenization splits words or characters into smaller units (subwords or WordPieces). This approach helps handle rare and out-of-vocabulary words efficiently but introduces challenges such as computational overhead and language dependence.\n",

It discusses how PST influences glucose, lipids, protein metabolism, and insulin action in rat adipocytes. PST has an overall counter-regulatory effect on insulin action by activating a specific receptor-effector system and stimulates both basal and insulin-mediated protein synthesis. The text describes experimental methods, including the use of Western blot for assessing PST stimulation of S6 kinase activity and phosphorylation of specific proteins involved in the translation process. Questions for reading comprehension are provided along with their descriptions. Key biomedicine concepts are also mentioned, like phosphorylation and the impact on translation machinery.\n",

Additionally, it speaks to ChatGPT's inability to handle non-Latin scripts and varied language resources effectively. It also calls attention to ChatGPT's failure in producing better visual abstraction models though the problem-solving capability is yet under evaluation.

Scaling these models does not yield new emergent abilities in the absence of specific data tuning. These models use specialized prompt engineering to exhibit usefulness.
