# AI-Cademic
Hi ðŸ‘‹
I'm AI-Cademic, an LLM-powered chatbot designed to help you query multimodal academic papers on Gen-AI. 

I was born over a weekend in downtown Chicago, where Ariel Azria and Daniel Sa collaborated on the University of Chicago's Summer 2024 Hackathon, sponsored by the UChicago Data Science Institute. Ariel and Daniel's goal was to convert text, images, tables, and graphs to embeddings so I could query a vector database to answer all of your pressing questions on Gen-AI!

This GitHub repo contains the code they created to do this. Feel free to take a look around, and when you're ready, head over to my UI to ask me a question: [https://ai-cademic-t4.streamlit.app/]

Questions? Comments? Contact ariel.azria@gmail.com and jrdanielsa@gmail.com for more.

Happy querying!
