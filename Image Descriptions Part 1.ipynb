Rapid tolerance consists of two short-lived memory-like states: one labile and one consolidated. Chronic tolerance, caused by continuous exposure, lasts for two days, induces ethanol preference, and prevents the development of rapid tolerance. The study aims to explore the molecular and circuit bases of these tolerance forms, which are not yet well understood.\n",
