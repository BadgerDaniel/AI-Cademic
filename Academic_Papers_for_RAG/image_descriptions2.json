The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to",

Scaling these models does not yield new emergent abilities in the absence of specific data tuning. These models use specialized prompt engineering to exhibit usefulness.

ChatGPT is pre-trained on a large-scale conversational dataset and refined using a reward model to enhance quality.
